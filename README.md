Overview:

SM Department Store is in need of your help. Due to the lockdown, the database administrator will not be able to go to the office. Create an ERD based on the Crow’s Foot notation, using the following requirements:

An INVOICE is written by a SALES REP. Each sales representative can write many invoices, but each invoice is written by a single sales representative.
The INVOICE is written for a single CUSTOMER. However, each customer can have many invoices.
An INVOICE can include many detail lines (LINE), each of which describes one product bought by the customer.
The product information is stored in a PRODUCT entity
The product’s vendor information is found in a VENDOR entity
